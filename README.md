ðŸ‘‡ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** ðŸ‘‡

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.


### Q2: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please **post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help there. Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.


### Q3: I want to put the project in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built it yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!


### Q4: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
